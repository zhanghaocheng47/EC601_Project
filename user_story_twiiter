I, as a user who use the Android or ios or any smart phone system, could be attractive to the new function of my own phone. 
I have hundreds of photos in my phone including all memories. 
The new function could automatically sort your album by identifying different people(basic), different theme (like, a travel), 
different place (like in gym) and make this sorts into short videos with a proper background music 
and a nice editing which is kind of skill-demanding for normal people.
Then I can post them into INS and tick tok.

As for the value, it is easy to image the commercial profit from different internet companies. 
Every one of them should has its own function like this if one of them started and were popular for the public.
